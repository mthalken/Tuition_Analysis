# US Tuition Analysis

## The purpose of this analysis was to look at tuition costs for US institutions for 4-year and 2-year colleges with graduation rates. We also looked at the average price of tuition per state. 

## Project Overview:
1. Organize, clean, and create tables to be able to present the data. 
2. Calculate the results for Cost for Tuition and Fees per Year, Graduation Rate for 2- and 4-Year Institutions, and Cost for Tuition and Fees by State and Year.  
3. Use Tableau make an interactive representation of the data.

## Resources
- Source of data: [graduation_rates](https://github.com/mthalken/Tuition_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/grad-rates.csv) and [cost_attendance](https://github.com/mthalken/Tuition_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/cost-attendance.csv)
- Software: Python 3.7.10, Conda 4.10.3, Jupyter Notebook 6.3.0, Visual Studio Code 1.60.2, Tableau Public 2021.3
- Please see the refactored code [here](https://github.com/mthalken/Tuition_Analysis/blob/main/final_code.ipynb).
- You can also see the preliminary code [here](https://github.com/mthalken/Tuition_Analysis/blob/main/cleaning_csv's.ipynb)

## The analysis
- From the data we can see that published tuition and fees is quite a bit lower than that of the actual costs for either living on campus or off campus. We can also see that there is a steady increase in the cost per year. Graduation rates for 4-year institutions are typically higher, further analysis could show cost vs graduation rates at 2 and 4 year institutions. As for the average cost by state and year we can see that some states can more than double the cost of tuition and fees than others. 

- Further analysis could look at the average tuition and fees by region, cost vs graduation rates at 2 and 4 year institutions, total cost including tuition and fees, and total student loans for 2- and 4-year institutions by state.
