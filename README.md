# US Tuition Analysis

## The purpose of this analysis was to look at tuition costs for US insitutions for 4 year and 2 year colleges with graduation rates. We also looked at the average price of tuition per state. 

## Project Overview:
1. Organize, clean, and create tables to be able to present the data. 
2. Calculate the results for Cost for Tuition and Fees per Year, Graduation Rate for 2 and 4 Year Institutions, and Cost for Tution and Fees by State and Year.  
3. Use Tableau make an interactive representation of the data.
